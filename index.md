# Welcome to Sir Gain's GitHub Page

Hi<i>!</i> My name is Jose *Isagani Cruz* Oloya. Students call me Sir Gain. I am using Github pages to teach my students about Markdown and Static Site Generators.

### Markdown Format

Markdown is much simpler than HTML. To learn more about Markdown, check this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab").

### Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators are generally faster than Dynamic Sites, hence their popularity. GitHub pages make use of the [Jekyll](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") Static Site Generator but there are other available generators on the Web. Check this [list](https://jamstack.org/generators/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") of popular Static Site Generators.

I have [another site](http://sirgain.droppages.com/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") that was created using [DropPages](https://droppages.com/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab"), a Static Site Generator for Dropbox.

### Multiple pages in GitHub Pages

In order to add additional pages that matches your theme you need to do some tinkering. Check out [this page](https://phuston.github.io/patrickandfrantonarethebestninjas/howto "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") to learn how to create multiple pages in GitHub. Alternatively, you can create additional repositories with individual pages and link all of them.

### Custom Theme

You can create your own custom theme but they involve some work of course. Check out [whoisjuan.github.io](http://whoisjuan.github.io/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") for an example.
