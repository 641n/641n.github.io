# Welcome to Sir Gain's GitHub Page

**Hi<i>!</i> My name is Jose Isagani Cruz Oloya**

Students call me Sir Gain. I am using Github pages to teach my students about Markdown and Static Site Generators.

### Markdown Format

Markdown is much simpler than HTML. To learn more about Markdown, check this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### Multiple pages in GitHub Pages

In order to add additional pages that matches your theme you need to do some tinkering. Check out [this page](https://phuston.github.io/patrickandfrantonarethebestninjas/howto) to learn how to create multiple pages in GitHub. Alternatively, you can create additional repositories with individual pages and link all of them.

### Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators are generally faster than Dynamic Sites, hence there popularity. GitHub pages make use of the [Jekyll](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/) Static Site Generator but there are other available generators on the Web. Check this [list](https://jamstack.org/generators/) of popular Static Site Generators.

This is my [other site](http://sirgain.droppages.com/) that was created using [DropPages](https://droppages.com/), a Static Site Generator for Dropbox.

### Custom Theme

You can create your own custom theme but they involve some work of course. Check this [example site](https://whoisjuan.me/).
